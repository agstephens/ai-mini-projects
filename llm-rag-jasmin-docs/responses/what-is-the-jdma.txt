HERE IS THE response.content:

 The Joint Data Migration App (JDMA) is a flexible tool for managing large migrations of data between a range of storage media. It can be used on JASMIN for migrating data to/from tape, disk, and object-store. JDMA provides a single API for users to move data to different storage systems, query stored data, and retrieve it. Users can interact with JDMA through a command-line tool, a Python library, or an HTTP API. The tool was designed with usability criteria in mind to ensure a consistent user experience, maintain user permissions, provide notifications for transfer completion, and allow data transfers between storage systems. JDMA is solely a request and query layer, and any data cataloging is handled by the backend system. For more detailed information on using JDMA, you can refer to the [JDMA user documentation](http://cedadev.github.io/jdma_client/docs/build/html/index.html).
